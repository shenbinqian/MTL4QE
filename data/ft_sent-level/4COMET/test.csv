足浴盆泡脚发麻是漏电了吗？,Is it electric leakage when soaking feet in the foot bath tub?,Does it mean there is leakage of electricity if my feet feel numb in the feet bath basin?,0.4097301217526274
选择合适的的足浴盆可以起到很好的足疗保健作用，今天国美小编将针对这个问题做出解答，希望对朋友们有所帮助。,"Choosing the right foot bath can play a very good role in pedicure and health care. Today, Gome Xiaobian will answer this question, hoping to help friends.","Choosing the right feet bath basin can provide good pedicure and healthcare, and today Gome will answer this question; hopefully it will be helpful to you.",-0.3325680607285569
随着人们保健意识的增强，足浴盆越来越受到消费者的喜爱，在市场上也涌现出一大批档次不同的产品，从一百多元到上千元的足浴盆琳琅满目，给了消费者很大的选择空间。,"With the enhancement of people's awareness of health care, foot bath tubs are more and more loved by consumers, and a large number of products of different grades have emerged in the market. Foot bath tubs ranging from more than 100 yuan to thousands of yuan are dazzling, giving consumers a great choice.","As people care more about healthcare, feet bath basin has become more popular among the customers, and a large batch of products of different levels have emerged on the market, from a little more than 100 yuan up to a thousand yuan, giving the customers a lot of options.",-0.3325680607285569
在相关的数据表面，与传统家电相比，足浴盆等保健类家电销售火爆，但足浴盆并没有专门行业标准，因此存在一定的安全隐患。,"On the surface of relevant data, compared with traditional household appliances, health appliances such as foot bath tubs are selling well, but there is no special industry standard for foot bath tubs, so there are certain potential safety hazards.","According to related statistics, compared with traditional home appliances, the sales of healthcare products such as feet bath basin was hot, but there is no specialized industry standard for feet bath basin and so there is potential safety risk.",-0.3325680607285569
“在带电的水里泡脚，实在太危险了吧!”,"""It is too dangerous to soak your feet in charged water!""",“Having a feet bath in the water with electricity is too dangerous!”,0.5953046673729235
李先生告诉记者，近日，他买了一个足浴盆送给父亲做生日礼物，可是父亲泡脚时却感觉脚底发麻。,"Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath tub for his father as a birthday present, but when his father soaked his feet, he felt numb on the soles of his feet.","Mr. Li told reporter that he recently bought a feet bath basin for his father as a birthday present, but his father felt that the bottom of his feet were numb when using it.",0.5953046673729235
李先生一开始以为是足浴盆的振动功能引起的，没想到关了振动功能，父亲还是感觉到脚底麻麻的。,"At first, Mr. Li thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath tub, but when the vibration function was turned off, his father still felt the soles of his feet numb.","Mr. Li first thought it was caused by the vibration function of the feet bath basin, and it was unexpected that his father still felt his feet were numb after turning off the vibration function.",0.5953046673729235
李先生用电笔一试，电笔居然亮了，李先生惊讶地发现足浴盆的水里居然带电。,"Mr. Li tried the electric pen, and the electric pen actually lit up. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath tub was actually charged.",Mr. Li used a tester and the light on it was on; it was to Mr. Li’s surprise that the water in the feet bath basin was electrified.,0.5953046673729235
后来他联络了商家，商家的态度还不错，尽管退掉了足浴盆，李先生依然感到不快。,"Later, he contacted the merchant, and the attitude of the merchant was not bad. Although he returned the foot bath tub, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.","Then he contacted the seller, whose attitude was nice, but Mr. Li still felt upset although he had returned it.",-0.3325680607285569
因为他发现这个已经流行已久的足浴盆如今在最高温度的设定、适用于何种人群、何种材料保证无害等方面都没有一个明确详细的行业规定。,"Because he found that this foot bath tub, which has been popular for a long time, now has no clear and detailed industry regulations on setting the maximum temperature, which people it is suitable for, and which materials are guaranteed to be harmless.","Because he found that feet bath basin, which has been popular for a long time, still has no explicit and detailed industry regulations on the setting of the maximum temperature, suitable crowd, what materials are safe to use, etc.",0.5953046673729235
但是一般情况下足浴盆是不会有带电问题的，但也不排除少数产品在出厂时没有严格把关。,"However, in general, there will be no electrification problem in the foot bath tub, but it is not excluded that a few products are not strictly controlled when leaving the factory.","But normally feet bath basin shouldn’t be electrified, however we can’t rule out the fact that a few products might not have been strictly checked before leaving the factory.",-1.260440788830037
因此在在购买的时候选择分体式的足浴盆。,"Therefore, when buying, choose a split foot bath tub.","Therefore, choose split type feet bath basin.",0.5953046673729235
水电分离，没有任何安全隐患。,Water and electricity are separated without any potential safety hazard.,There is no safety risk when water and electricity are separated.,0.5767472128108939
同时你可以随便拿电笔测。,"At the same time, you can take an electric pen at will.","Meanwhile, you can use a tester to test it.",0.4097301217526274

地 址：环城南路156号幸福家园12楼,"Address: 12th Floor, Happiness Home, No.156 Huancheng South Road","Address: Happy Home Building 12, South Ring Road 156",0.5953046673729235
一开始是朋友介绍的因为信任，所以选择来看一下起初我的预算是7万做个基本装修。,"At first, it was introduced by friends because of trust, so I chose to have a look. At first, my budget was 70,000 to do a basic decoration.","I trusted it because my friend made the recommendation, so I chose to check it out, and originally my budget for a basic decoration was 70,000.",-0.703717151969149
来到店里就开始一系列的骗术。,"When I came to the store, I began a series of tricks.",A series of scam began as soon as I came into the store.,-0.3325680607285569
我是第一次到店只是给他们看了我的户型图，他们并没有去实地量过房子，他们居然就能给我报价说我的135的房子7万是可以搞定的，大概的给我看了一下他们的材料也并不知道他们是什么品牌的材料。,"I went to the store for the first time and only showed them my floor plan. They didn't go to the field to measure the house. They actually quoted me a price saying that my 135 house of 70,000 can be done. They roughly showed me their materials and didn't know what brand of materials they were.","When I first came to the store, I showed them my floor plan; although they didn’t really go to my apartment to take the measurement, they said they could do it within 70,000 for my 135 square meters apartment, and they showed me their materials whose brand was unclear.",-1.260440788830037
他们的第二套骗术就是你只要到店就会拖着你把定金交了（而这个钱一旦交了你是永远退不出来，除非你有足够的经历和他们打理论战）。,"Their second trick is that as soon as you arrive at the store, you will drag you to pay the deposit (and once you pay the money, you will never return it unless you have enough experience to fight with them in theory).","The second scam was forcing you to pay the deposit, which cannot be refunded once paid, unless you have enough experience to reason with them.",-2.188313516931517
我在犹豫要不要交定金的时候，他们就会邀请他们所谓的经理来告诉你，你今天只要把定金交了我们就能给你多少的优惠。,"When I hesitate to pay the deposit, they invite their so-called manager to tell you how much discount we can give you as long as you pay the deposit today.","As I hesitated about whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me that once I paid the deposit on that day, they could give me certain discount.",-3.48733533627359
这个就是一个大坑，我就是活生生被骗的例子，在头脑冲动的时候，交了一万多的定金。,"This is a big pit. I am a living example of being cheated. When my mind is impulsive, I paid more than 10,000 deposits.","This is a big swindle, and I was a victim who paid a deposit of more than 10,000 when I didn’t really think it through.",-1.260440788830037
他给我的报价有很多问题7万不包括水电改造，不包括任何门和橱柜 浴室，而这三个就是基装的费用大头。,"His offer to me had a lot of problems. 70,000 did not include water and electricity renovation, and did not include any doors and cabinets and bathrooms, and these three were the bulk of the cost of basic installation.","Their quoted price had a lot of problems; for instance, the 70,000 didn’t include water and electricity renovation, doors, cabinets or bathrooms, and these three take up a large proportion of the cost of basic installation.",-1.4645727890123628
除去这些他们的服务点费收的也比其他家公司的高。,"Apart from these, their service point fees are higher than those of other companies.","Apart from these, their service point fee is also higher than that of other companies.",0.5953046673729235
我对这个公司失去了信任，一开始什么都没有讲清楚就让我签合同。,I lost trust in this company and asked me to sign the contract without making anything clear at first.,"I’ve lost trust in this company, because they asked me to sign the contract when they didn’t explain anything clearly.",-0.3325680607285569
当我去找他们退钱的时候他们表现出很有经验的样子，有专门的小团队来对付你。,"When I asked them for a refund, they showed great experience and had a small team to deal with you.","When I went to ask for a refund, they acted rather experienced and sent a small team to deal with me.",-1.260440788830037
无论如何都会一口咬死是客户的问题他们全然无责。,"It's the customer's problem that they will bite to death in one bite anyway, and they are totally irresponsible.","Anyway, they just said it was the client’s problem and they had absolutely no responsibility for it.",-1.260440788830037
各种推卸责任，还有很多细节，不想一一说了都是泪，总之不要选择他们，因为我朋友找他们装修的房子也是质量不好，后期给你算各种费用。,"All kinds of shirking responsibility, there are many details, don't want to say one by one are tears, in short, don't choose them, because my friend looking for them to decorate the house is also of poor quality, and I will calculate various expenses for you later.","They just shrunk their responsibility in any way possible, and there were a lot more details that I don’t want to mention now; all in all, do not choose them because my friend had them renovate her apartment, and the quality was poor and they would charge you all kinds of other costs in the later stage.",-2.2068709714935477
坑爹，他们就是原来骗人的龙头装饰，现在改成大美，好像又倒闭了又改成其他的。,"Pit dad, they are the original deceptive faucet decoration, and now they are changed into Damei, which seems to have closed down and changed into other ones.","Swindle; they used to be the swindler company Longtou Renovation, then it’s changed to Damei, and now it seems they have closed down and changed into something else.",-2.188313516931517
所以大家别选择这样坑爹的装修公司。,So don't choose such a decorating company.,So please don’t choose such a swindler company.,-0.3325680607285569
以后大家在选择的时候多百度看看这些查一下这些咨询因为装修不是小钱。,"In the future, when you choose Baidu, look at these and check these consultations because decoration is not a small sum of money.","When you choose renovation companies in the future, please search them on Baidu because renovation cost is not a small amount.",-1.4460153344503333

去之前看了店里的拍摄作品，更多的是户外婚纱，拍的很漂亮，涉及到的拍摄风格也很多。,"Before going, I saw the shooting works in the store, more of which were outdoor wedding dresses, which were very beautiful and involved many shooting styles.","I went to the store to see the photography works, and there were more beautiful outdoor wedding dress photos and a lot of different styles.",-0.703717151969149
当天到了之后和小姐姐简单交流了自己的想法，非常耐心地帮我试了两套我纠结的风格衣服，最终敲定开始化妆造型~摄影师拍摄之前会摆一些道具，会指导动作，对各个细节也比较精益求精。,"After arriving that day, I briefly exchanged my thoughts with my little sister, patiently helped me try two sets of clothes with my tangled style, and finally decided to start makeup modeling ~ The photographer will put some props before shooting, guide the movements, and strive for perfection in every detail.","After I arrived that day, I communicated my own ideas with the young lady and she patiently helped me try on two outfits I was having trouble deciding and I made the final decision before starting styling and makeup~ the photographer would place some props and guide me to pose before the shoot, and was very attentive to the details.",-3.134743699595028
但是可能因为没和我交流具体的拍摄想法，所以拍出来的不是我想要的风格，但是应该是好看的🙊🙊,"But maybe because I didn't communicate with me about the specific shooting ideas, the shooting style is not what I want, but it should be a good-looking 🙊🙊","However, the photos taken were not in the style I wanted, perhaps it was because they didn’t communicate with me about the specific shooting ideas, but the photos should look nice🙊🙊",-1.260440788830037
拍好之后摄影师会帮忙挑选照片，交流后期风格，感觉挺细心的叭。,"After shooting, the photographer will help to select photos and exchange later styles, which makes me feel very careful.","After the shoot, the photographer would help pick the photos, communicate about post-editing style, and I think it was very thoughtful.",-2.188313516931517

最后选择了一件黑色的纱裙，体验下不同的风格。,"Finally, I chose a black veil to experience different styles.","Eventually, I chose a black veil skirt so as to experience a different style.",-0.3325680607285569
整个拍摄过程要2个小时左右，化妆+拍摄，负责拍摄的摄影师是95后的弟弟呢，感觉稍微还是有点青涩，希望在顾客拍摄动作指导方面以后能给更多的建议呀～挺健谈的，拍摄过程比较愉快。,"The whole shooting process takes about 2 hours, makeup + shooting. The photographer in charge of shooting is the younger brother of the post-95 s, and he feels a little green. I hope I can give more suggestions on the guidance of customers' shooting actions in the future ~ it is quite talkative and the shooting process is pleasant.","The entire photoshoot took about 2 hours including the makeup and shoot; the photographer was a young guy born after 1995, who seemed to be a little shy; I hope he could give more advice to clients in terms of poses~ he was talkative and the shoot was pleasant.",-4.433765518937101

到店先填了姓名电话然后选服装，婚纱都可以选，换了三四套服装还蛮耐心的，选好后化妆化了很久，服务态度也好，后面拍摄会教你怎么摆造型，就是拍出来的感觉脸好大，精修说是要半个月，三四天就发来了，感觉好像跟原片没啥差别,"When you go to the store, you can fill in your name and phone number first and then choose your clothes.

众所周知，在事故发生后救护车来的过程中其实是还有一段时间的，而正是这段时间才是最关键的。,"As we all know, there is still a period of time before the ambulance arrives after an accident, and it is this time that is the most critical.","As everyone knows, there is a period before the coming of the ambulance after the accident happens, which is most critical.",0.4097301217526274

当我们身边有人倒下的时候，我们可以通过专业的知识去对他进行抢救，而不是傻傻地站在那里一动不动什么也做不了，这种无助的感觉太让人感到可怕了。,"When someone around us falls down, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue him, instead of just standing there motionless.

我发现我们现在还很少人会有这种意识去学习急救，但是当事情发生的时候就来不及了，所以还是呼吁大家都去学习一下这个技能，让我们在面对突发状况的时候能够及时作出反应。,"I found that few of us have the awareness to learn first aid when something happens, so I still urge everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond in time when facing emergencies.","I found that very few people have the awareness to study first aid knowledge, but it will be too late once accident happens; therefore, I appeal to everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond timely when faced with emergency situations.",-0.3325680607285569

身体胖的女孩穿的裙子不能太短或太长，长度差不多在膝盖，刚好能盖住大腿胖的地方即可。,The skirts worn by fat girls should not be too short or too long. They should be almost around the knees and just enough to cover the fat areas on the thighs.,"Slightly overweight girls shall wear skirts not too long or too short; they shall be of the length at around the knees, just covering the fat part of the thighs.",0.5953046673729235
裙子过短就会把腿上的肥胖显露出来。,A skirt that is too short will reveal the fat on the legs.,The fat thighs will be shown if the skirt is too short.,0.5953046673729235
过长就会给人矮而胖的感觉。,"If it is too long, it will give people a sense of being short and fat.",Skirts that are too long will make you look short and fat.,0.5953046673729235
如果穿出分出上中下三段来，就显得你自然增高了，就是上身、裙和长筒袜用不同的颜色，看上去就会产生一种修长的感觉 。,"If you wear it into three sections (upper, middle and lower), it looks like you naturally increase in height, and you will look taller if your upper body, skirt and stockings are of different colors.","If you are dressed in three sections, upper, middle and lower, you will naturally look taller; that is, use different colors for upper body, skirt and stockings, and you will look taller and slimmer.",0.5953046673729235
其实很多深色系的衣服是微胖女孩子们的标配（这一点作者深有体会），深颜色也是掩盖你身体胖的好方法，高贵典雅的黑色短裙也是微胖女孩的首选。,"In fact, many dark clothes are standard for the fat girls (I fully understand this), and dark colors are also a good way to conceal your body fat. Elegant black skirts are also the first choice for fat girls.","In fact, a lot of darker color clothes are what slightly overweight girls all have, which the author deeply agrees; dark colors are good methods to cover fatness of your bodies; in addition, noble and elegant black short shirts are best choices for slightly overweight girls.",0.5953046673729235

微胖女孩千万不要穿紧身的短裙，另外上衣不要过短或者塞在裙子里，会让人看了很不舒服，如果腿粗的话，要穿黑色的长筒袜或者网格袜(细格子的那种哦)，选择质地柔软的印花喇叭裙，搭配一件荡领的上衣，可以很好的掩盖胖女孩的不足。,"If the legs are thick, they must wear black stockings or mesh socks (fine-plaided kind). Choose a flabby print skirt with a soft texture and a top with a swing collar to cover up the deficiencies of fat girls.","Slightly overweight girls shall never wear close-fitting short skirts and the upper outer garment shall not be too short or tucked inside the skirt, which seem strange; slightly overweight girls with thicker legs shall wear black stockings or mesh stockings (thin meshes), a flare skirt with print pattern and soft texture, and a loose-collar upper outer garment to cover the defects of the body.",-0.3325680607285569

选择合适的的足浴盆可以起到很好的足疗保健作用，今天国美小编将针对这个问题做出解答，希望对朋友们有所帮助。,"Choosing a suitable foot bath can play a good role in improving foot care and health. Today, the Gome editor will answer this question.

随着人们保健意识的增强，足浴盆越来越受到消费者的喜爱，在市场上也涌现出一大批档次不同的产品，从一百多元到上千元的足浴盆琳琅满目，给了消费者很大的选择空间。,"With people's increasing health consciousness, foot tubs are becoming more and more popular among consumers. Also, a large number of products of various grades have come into the market, offering many choices for consumers.","As people care more about healthcare, feet bath basin has become more popular among the customers, and a large batch of products of different levels have emerged on the market, from a little more than 100 yuan up to a thousand yuan, giving the customers a lot of options.",-0.3325680607285569
在相关的数据表面，与传统家电相比，足浴盆等保健类家电销售火爆，但足浴盆并没有专门行业标准，因此存在一定的安全隐患。,"Compared with traditional household appliances, health appliances such as foot tubs are selling well, but there is no industry standard for foot tubs, so they pose certain security risks.","According to related statistics, compared with traditional home appliances, the sales of healthcare products such as feet bath basin was hot, but there is no specialized industry standard for feet bath basin and so there is potential safety risk.",0.5953046673729235
“在带电的水里泡脚，实在太危险了吧!”,“It is too dangerous to soak your feet in electrically charged water!”,“Having a feet bath in the water with electricity is too dangerous!”,0.5953046673729235
李先生告诉记者，近日，他买了一个足浴盆送给父亲做生日礼物，可是父亲泡脚时却感觉脚底发麻。,"Mr. Li told reporters that, recently, he bought a foot bath to give his father as a birthday present, but his feet felt numb when he soaked.","Mr. Li told reporter that he recently bought a feet bath basin for his father as a birthday present, but his father felt that the bottom of his feet were numb when using it.",0.5953046673729235
李先生一开始以为是足浴盆的振动功能引起的，没想到关了振动功能，父亲还是感觉到脚底麻麻的。,"At first Mr. Li thought it was caused by vibration in the foot bath, but when the vibration function turned off, his father felt numbness in the soles of his feet.","Mr. Li first thought it was caused by the vibration function of the feet bath basin, and it was unexpected that his father still felt his feet were numb after turning off the vibration function.",0.5953046673729235
李先生用电笔一试，电笔居然亮了，李先生惊讶地发现足浴盆的水里居然带电。,"When Mr. Li tried it with an electric pen, it turned on. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the footbath was charged with electricity.",Mr. Li used a tester and the light on it was on; it was to Mr. Li’s surprise that the water in the feet bath basin was electrified.,0.5953046673729235
后来他联络了商家，商家的态度还不错，尽管退掉了足浴盆，李先生依然感到不快。,"Later, he contacted the merchant, and the attitude of the merchant was quite good. Although the foot tub had been returned, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.","Then he contacted the seller, whose attitude was nice, but Mr. Li still felt upset although he had returned it.",0.5953046673729235
因为他发现这个已经流行已久的足浴盆如今在最高温度的设定、适用于何种人群、何种材料保证无害等方面都没有一个明确详细的行业规定。,"He found out the footbath that has been popular for a long time now has no clear and detailed industrial regulation in terms of the maximum temperature settings, what kind of people it is suitable for, and which materials are guaranteed to be harmless.","Because he found that feet bath basin, which has been popular for a long time, still has no explicit and detailed industry regulations on the setting of the maximum temperature, suitable crowd, what materials are safe to use, etc.",0.5953046673729235
但是一般情况下足浴盆是不会有带电问题的，但也不排除少数产品在出厂时没有严格把关。,"However, under normal circumstances, there will be no electrification issues for foot bath tubs, but it is not ruled out that a few products are not strictly inspected when they leave the factory.","But normally feet bath basin shouldn’t be electrified, however we can’t rule out the fact that a few products might not have been strictly checked before leaving the factory.",0.5953046673729235
因此在在购买的时候选择分体式的足浴盆。,"Therefore, choose a split-type foot tub when purchasing.","Therefore, choose split type feet bath basin.",0.5953046673729235
水电分离，没有任何安全隐患。,The separation of water and electricity means there is no safety hazard.,There is no safety risk when water and electricity are separated.,0.5953046673729235

地 址：环城南路156号幸福家园12楼,"Address: 12th Floor, Happy Home, No.156 South Huancheng Road","Address: Happy Home Building 12, South Ring Road 156",0.5953046673729235
一开始是朋友介绍的因为信任，所以选择来看一下起初我的预算是7万做个基本装修。,"At first it was recommended by a friend because of trust, so I chose to have a look at it. At first my budget was 70,000 for a basic decoration.","I trusted it because my friend made the recommendation, so I chose to check it out, and originally my budget for a basic decoration was 70,000.",-0.7408320610932064
来到店里就开始一系列的骗术。,"As soon as I arrived in the store, a series of scams started.",A series of scam began as soon as I came into the store.,0.4097301217526274
我是第一次到店只是给他们看了我的户型图，他们并没有去实地量过房子，他们居然就能给我报价说我的135的房子7万是可以搞定的，大概的给我看了一下他们的材料也并不知道他们是什么品牌的材料。,"It was the first time I came to the shop and just showed them my house layout chart. They didn't visit my home. But they were able to quote me the price of a house worth $70,000. They showed me their materials and didn't know what their brands are.","When I first came to the store, I showed them my floor plan; although they didn’t really go to my apartment to take the measurement, they said they could do it within 70,000 for my 135 square meters apartment, and they showed me their materials whose brand was unclear.",-2.559462608172109
他们的第二套骗术就是你只要到店就会拖着你把定金交了（而这个钱一旦交了你是永远退不出来，除非你有足够的经历和他们打理论战）。,"Their second trick is that as soon as you get there they will drag you over to pay the deposit (and once the money is paid, you can never get it back unless you have enough experience to argue with them).","The second scam was forcing you to pay the deposit, which cannot be refunded once paid, unless you have enough experience to reason with them.",-0.3511255152905864
我在犹豫要不要交定金的时候，他们就会邀请他们所谓的经理来告诉你，你今天只要把定金交了我们就能给你多少的优惠。,"When I was hesitating whether to pay a deposit, they invited their so called manager to tell you how much discount we can give you as long as you pay the deposit today.","As I hesitated about whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me that once I paid the deposit on that day, they could give me certain discount.",-0.5367000609108825
这个就是一个大坑，我就是活生生被骗的例子，在头脑冲动的时候，交了一万多的定金。,"This is a big pit. I am a living example of being cheated. When I was impulsive, I paid a deposit of more than ten thousand.","This is a big swindle, and I was a victim who paid a deposit of more than 10,000 when I didn’t really think it through.",-0.5181426063488529
他给我的报价有很多问题7万不包括水电改造，不包括任何门和橱柜 浴室，而这三个就是基装的费用大头。,"The quote he gave me had many problems. The $70k didn’t include electrical renovations, any doors, cabinets and bathrooms. Those three were the bulk of the installing cost.","Their quoted price had a lot of problems; for instance, the 70,000 didn’t include water and electricity renovation, doors, cabinets or bathrooms, and these three take up a large proportion of the cost of basic installation.",-2.373888062551813
除去这些他们的服务点费收的也比其他家公司的高。,"In addition to these, their point of service charges are also higher than those of other companies.","Apart from these, their service point fee is also higher than that of other companies.",0.5767472128108939
我对这个公司失去了信任，一开始什么都没有讲清楚就让我签合同。,I lost trust in this company and they made me sign the contract without clarifying anything at first.,"I’ve lost trust in this company, because they asked me to sign the contract when they didn’t explain anything clearly.",0.5767472128108939
当我去找他们退钱的时候他们表现出很有经验的样子，有专门的小团队来对付你。,When I went to them to refund money they seemed very experienced and there was a small team dedicated to dealing with you.,"When I went to ask for a refund, they acted rather experienced and sent a small team to deal with me.",-0.3511255152905864
无论如何都会一口咬死是客户的问题他们全然无责。,"Either way it's the client's problem, and they have absolutely no fault for it.","Anyway, they just said it was the client’s problem and they had absolutely no responsibility for it.",0.5767472128108939
各种推卸责任，还有很多细节，不想一一说了都是泪，总之不要选择他们，因为我朋友找他们装修的房子也是质量不好，后期给你算各种费用。,"There are various shirks of responsibility and many details. I am crying if I don't want to say them all. In short, do not choose them, because the quality of the houses my friends have renovated with them is also poor. I will pay you for all kinds of expenses later.","They just shrunk their responsibility in any way possible, and there were a lot more details that I don’t want to mention now; all in all, do not choose them because my friend had them renovate her apartment, and the quality was poor and they would charge you all kinds of other costs in the later stage.",-3.48733533627359
坑爹，他们就是原来骗人的龙头装饰，现在改成大美，好像又倒闭了又改成其他的。,"Crap, they were deceptive faucets and now they’ve been replaced by Damei, which seems to have retreated and become something else.","Swindle; they used to be the swindler company Longtou Renovation, then it’s changed to Damei, and now it seems they have closed down and changed into something else.",-3.116186245032998
所以大家别选择这样坑爹的装修公司。,So do not choose such an unprofessional decoration company.,So please don’t choose such a swindler company.,-0.3325680607285569
以后大家在选择的时候多百度看看这些查一下这些咨询因为装修不是小钱。,"In the future, everyone can look upon these websites more on Baidu when they are making decisions as the decoration is not expensive.","When you choose renovation companies in the future, please search them on Baidu because renovation cost is not a small amount.",-1.260440788830037

去之前看了店里的拍摄作品，更多的是户外婚纱，拍的很漂亮，涉及到的拍摄风格也很多。,"Before I went there, I had seen the shoots on camera. It mostly involved outdoor wedding dresses. The shoot is very beautiful and involves many shooting styles.","I went to the store to see the photography works, and there were more beautiful outdoor wedding dress photos and a lot of different styles.",-2.188313516931517
当天到了之后和小姐姐简单交流了自己的想法，非常耐心地帮我试了两套我纠结的风格衣服，最终敲定开始化妆造型~摄影师拍摄之前会摆一些道具，会指导动作，对各个细节也比较精益求精。,"When the day arrived, I briefly shared my ideas with my sister. I patiently tried on two sets of styles I had trouble with, and finally finished makeup and styling ~ The photographer will set up some props and guide the movements before filming, while keeping the details to perfection.","After I arrived that day, I communicated my own ideas with the young lady and she patiently helped me try on two outfits I was having trouble deciding and I made the final decision before starting styling and makeup~ the photographer would place some props and guide me to pose before the shoot, and was very attentive to the details.",-4.990489155797989
但是可能因为没和我交流具体的拍摄想法，所以拍出来的不是我想要的风格，但是应该是好看的🙊🙊,"But perhaps because I didn't share specific shooting ideas with me, the style I created was not what I wanted, but it should be pretty lovely🙊🙊","However, the photos taken were not in the style I wanted, perhaps it was because they didn’t communicate with me about the specific shooting ideas, but the photos should look nice🙊🙊",-2.188313516931517
拍好之后摄影师会帮忙挑选照片，交流后期风格，感觉挺细心的叭。,"After the shooting is done, the photographer will help choose the photos and exchange post-processing styles, so I felt very careful.","After the shoot, the photographer would help pick the photos, communicate about post-editing style, and I think it was very thoughtful.",-1.260440788830037

最后选择了一件黑色的纱裙，体验下不同的风格。,"Finally, I chose a black gauze skirt to experience a different style.","Eventually, I chose a black veil skirt so as to experience a different style.",0.5953046673729235
整个拍摄过程要2个小时左右，化妆+拍摄，负责拍摄的摄影师是95后的弟弟呢，感觉稍微还是有点青涩，希望在顾客拍摄动作指导方面以后能给更多的建议呀～挺健谈的，拍摄过程比较愉快。,"The entire shooting process takes about 2 hours, makeup + shooting, and the photographer in charge is the brother of the post-95s generation. I feel a little bit young. I hope to give more suggestions in the future for customer shooting instructions. It is chatty and the shooting process is pleasant.","The entire photoshoot took about 2 hours including the makeup and shoot; the photographer was a young guy born after 1995, who seemed to be a little shy; I hope he could give more advice to clients in terms of poses~ he was talkative and the shoot was pleasant.",-4.062616427696508

到店先填了姓名电话然后选服装，婚纱都可以选，换了三四套服装还蛮耐心的，选好后化妆化了很久，服务态度也好，后面拍摄会教你怎么摆造型，就是拍出来的感觉脸好大，精修说是要半个月，三四天就发来了，感觉好像跟原片没啥差别,"After arriving, fill in the name number and phone number, then select the clothes.

普及一下：急救措施其实是做发生突发事件时候的应急救援，即在救护车来之前的抢救。,"Tips: First aid measures are actually emergency rescue in case of emergencies, which means that it is a rescue before the arrival of ambulances.","For your information: first aid measures refer to emergency rescue in emergencies, i.e., emergency treatment conducted before the coming of the ambulance.",0.5953046673729235
众所周知，在事故发生后救护车来的过程中其实是还有一段时间的，而正是这段时间才是最关键的。,"As we all know, there is still a period of time after the accident when the ambulance arrives, which is the most important.","As everyone knows, there is a period before the coming of the ambulance after the accident happens, which is most critical.",0.5953046673729235

所以身边的人懂得急救是多么重要呀！,So how important it is for people around you to know about the first aid!,So it is very important for those around us to know first aid!,-1.260440788830037
当我们身边有人倒下的时候，我们可以通过专业的知识去对他进行抢救，而不是傻傻地站在那里一动不动什么也做不了，这种无助的感觉太让人感到可怕了。,"When someone falls around us, we can rescue him with professional knowledge instead of standing still and doing nothing.

我发现我们现在还很少人会有这种意识去学习急救，但是当事情发生的时候就来不及了，所以还是呼吁大家都去学习一下这个技能，让我们在面对突发状况的时候能够及时作出反应。,"I found that few people now have this awareness to learn first aid, but it is too late when things happen, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond in time when facing emergencies.","I found that very few people have the awareness to study first aid knowledge, but it will be too late once accident happens; therefore, I appeal to everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond timely when faced with emergency situations.",0.5953046673729235

PS：最后一张图是记录自己25岁前要完成的目标的，把急救证加入目标清单也是几个月前的事情，但是确实是完成了呀！,"PS: The last picture is a record of the goals to be achieved before the age of 25.

接着要去考其他想考的证书了，打算去考个潜水证，之前在小红书看到还有个潜水急救证，考这个证好像还得有急救证才可以去考，所以其实急救证还是很有用的！,"Then I'm going to take other certificates I want. I'm going to take a diving certificate.

足浴盆泡脚发麻是漏电了吗？,Foot bathtub bubble feet numbness is electric leakage?,Does it mean there is leakage of electricity if my feet feel numb in the feet bath basin?,-0.3325680607285569
选择合适的的足浴盆可以起到很好的足疗保健作用，今天国美小编将针对这个问题做出解答，希望对朋友们有所帮助。,"Choosing the right foot bathtub can play a good role in foot health care. Today, Gome will answer this question, hoping to help friends.","Choosing the right feet bath basin can provide good pedicure and healthcare, and today Gome will answer this question; hopefully it will be helpful to you.",0.4097301217526274
随着人们保健意识的增强，足浴盆越来越受到消费者的喜爱，在市场上也涌现出一大批档次不同的产品，从一百多元到上千元的足浴盆琳琅满目，给了消费者很大的选择空间。,"With the enhancement of people's awareness of health care, foot bathtubs are more and more popular with consumers. A large number of products of different grades have emerged in the market, from more than RMB 100 to more  than 1000 RMB foot bathtubs, which gives consumers a great choice.","As people care more about healthcare, feet bath basin has become more popular among the customers, and a large batch of products of different levels have emerged on the market, from a little more than 100 yuan up to a thousand yuan, giving the customers a lot of options.",0.5953046673729235
在相关的数据表面，与传统家电相比，足浴盆等保健类家电销售火爆，但足浴盆并没有专门行业标准，因此存在一定的安全隐患。,"On the relevant data surface, compared with traditional household appliances, health appliances such as foot bathtubs are sold well, but there is no special industry standard for foot bathtubs, so there are certain potential safety hazards.","According to related statistics, compared with traditional home appliances, the sales of healthcare products such as feet bath basin was hot, but there is no specialized industry standard for feet bath basin and so there is potential safety risk.",0.5953046673729235
“在带电的水里泡脚，实在太危险了吧!”,"""It's too dangerous to soak your feet in charged water!""",“Having a feet bath in the water with electricity is too dangerous!”,0.5953046673729235
李先生告诉记者，近日，他买了一个足浴盆送给父亲做生日礼物，可是父亲泡脚时却感觉脚底发麻。,"Mr.Li told the reporter that recently, he bought a foot bathtub as his father's birthday gift, but his father felt numb when soaking his feet.","Mr. Li told reporter that he recently bought a feet bath basin for his father as a birthday present, but his father felt that the bottom of his feet were numb when using it.",0.5953046673729235
李先生一开始以为是足浴盆的振动功能引起的，没想到关了振动功能，父亲还是感觉到脚底麻麻的。,"At first, Mr.Li thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bathtub. Unexpectedly, after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt numbness in the soles of his feet.","Mr. Li first thought it was caused by the vibration function of the feet bath basin, and it was unexpected that his father still felt his feet were numb after turning off the vibration function.",0.5953046673729235
李先生用电笔一试，电笔居然亮了，李先生惊讶地发现足浴盆的水里居然带电。,"When Mr.Li tried the pencil, it lit up. Li Xiansheng was surprised to find that the water in the foot bathtub was charged.",Mr. Li used a tester and the light on it was on; it was to Mr. Li’s surprise that the water in the feet bath basin was electrified.,-1.260440788830037
后来他联络了商家，商家的态度还不错，尽管退掉了足浴盆，李先生依然感到不快。,"Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was not bad. Despite withdrawing the foot bathtub, Mr.Li still felt unhappy.","Then he contacted the seller, whose attitude was nice, but Mr. Li still felt upset although he had returned it.",0.4097301217526274
因为他发现这个已经流行已久的足浴盆如今在最高温度的设定、适用于何种人群、何种材料保证无害等方面都没有一个明确详细的行业规定。,"Because he found that the long-established foot tub now has no clear and detailed industry rules for setting the maximum temperature, what kind of people it is intended for, and what kind of material it is made to be harmless.","Because he found that feet bath basin, which has been popular for a long time, still has no explicit and detailed industry regulations on the setting of the maximum temperature, suitable crowd, what materials are safe to use, etc.",0.5953046673729235
但是一般情况下足浴盆是不会有带电问题的，但也不排除少数产品在出厂时没有严格把关。,"However, under normal circumstances, there will be no live problems in foot bathtubs, but it is not excluded that a few products are not strictly controlled when leaving the factory.","But normally feet bath basin shouldn’t be electrified, however we can’t rule out the fact that a few products might not have been strictly checked before leaving the factory.",0.5953046673729235
因此在在购买的时候选择分体式的足浴盆。,So choose a split foot tub at the time of purchase.,"Therefore, choose split type feet bath basin.",0.4097301217526274
水电分离，没有任何安全隐患。,"Separation of water and electricity, no safety hazard.",There is no safety risk when water and electricity are separated.,0.4097301217526274
同时你可以随便拿电笔测。,"At the same time, you can take an electronic pencil to test it.","Meanwhile, you can use a tester to test it.",0.5953046673729235

一开始是朋友介绍的因为信任，所以选择来看一下起初我的预算是7万做个基本装修。,"At first, I was introduced by my friend. Because of trust, I chose to have a look. At first, my budget was RMB 70,000 for basic decoration.","I trusted it because my friend made the recommendation, so I chose to check it out, and originally my budget for a basic decoration was 70,000.",-0.3325680607285569
来到店里就开始一系列的骗术。,"When I came to the store, they started  a series of tricks.",A series of scam began as soon as I came into the store.,0.5953046673729235
我是第一次到店只是给他们看了我的户型图，他们并没有去实地量过房子，他们居然就能给我报价说我的135的房子7万是可以搞定的，大概的给我看了一下他们的材料也并不知道他们是什么品牌的材料。,"The first time I came to the shop, I just showed them my apartment layout.They didn't go to the site to measure the house. But they  could actually give me a quote saying that my 135-square-meter house could be decorated within 70,000 yuan.They roughly showed me their materials but I didn't know what brand of materials they used.","When I first came to the store, I showed them my floor plan; although they didn’t really go to my apartment to take the measurement, they said they could do it within 70,000 for my 135 square meters apartment, and they showed me their materials whose brand was unclear.",0.3726152126285683
他们的第二套骗术就是你只要到店就会拖着你把定金交了（而这个钱一旦交了你是永远退不出来，除非你有足够的经历和他们打理论战）。,"Their second scam is that the moment you  arrive at the store, they will drag you to pay the deposit( and once this money is paid you are never refunded unless you have enough experience to try argument with them).","The second scam was forcing you to pay the deposit, which cannot be refunded once paid, unless you have enough experience to reason with them.",-0.3696829698526143
我在犹豫要不要交定金的时候，他们就会邀请他们所谓的经理来告诉你，你今天只要把定金交了我们就能给你多少的优惠。,"When I'm hesitating to pay the deposit, they'll invite their so-called managers to tell you how much discount you'll get if you pay the deposit today.","As I hesitated about whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me that once I paid the deposit on that day, they could give me certain discount.",0.5953046673729235
这个就是一个大坑，我就是活生生被骗的例子，在头脑冲动的时候，交了一万多的定金。,"This is a big pit. I am a living example of being deceived. When I am impulsive, I pay more than 10,000 yuan as a deposit.","This is a big swindle, and I was a victim who paid a deposit of more than 10,000 when I didn’t really think it through.",-0.703717151969149
他给我的报价有很多问题7万不包括水电改造，不包括任何门和橱柜 浴室，而这三个就是基装的费用大头。,"There are a lot of questions about their quote. 70,000 yuan doesn't include the reconstruction of water and electricity, nor any door or bathroom, and  these three parts accounting the biggest part of the basic decoration.","Their quoted price had a lot of problems; for instance, the 70,000 didn’t include water and electricity renovation, doors, cabinets or bathrooms, and these three take up a large proportion of the cost of basic installation.",-1.4460153344503333
除去这些他们的服务点费收的也比其他家公司的高。,"Excluding these,their service fees are higher than those of other companies.","Apart from these, their service point fee is also higher than that of other companies.",0.5767472128108939
我对这个公司失去了信任，一开始什么都没有讲清楚就让我签合同。,I lost my trust in this company and was told to sign the contract at the beginning without any clear explanation.,"I’ve lost trust in this company, because they asked me to sign the contract when they didn’t explain anything clearly.",0.5953046673729235
当我去找他们退钱的时候他们表现出很有经验的样子，有专门的小团队来对付你。,When I went to the store for a refund they acted like they were very experienced and had a small team dedicated to dealing with you.,"When I went to ask for a refund, they acted rather experienced and sent a small team to deal with me.",0.5767472128108939
无论如何都会一口咬死是客户的问题他们全然无责。,"No matter what, they would insist that it was the customer's problem and they were not responsible for it at all.","Anyway, they just said it was the client’s problem and they had absolutely no responsibility for it.",0.5953046673729235
各种推卸责任，还有很多细节，不想一一说了都是泪，总之不要选择他们，因为我朋友找他们装修的房子也是质量不好，后期给你算各种费用。,"They have all kinds of excuses and there are many details. I don't want to tell you one by one . All in all, don't choose them, because the quality of the house that my friend found them to decorate is also not good, and they tried their best to let you pay all kinds of fees later.","They just shrunk their responsibility in any way possible, and there were a lot more details that I don’t want to mention now; all in all, do not choose them because my friend had them renovate her apartment, and the quality was poor and they would charge you all kinds of other costs in the later stage.",0.5767472128108939
坑爹，他们就是原来骗人的龙头装饰，现在改成大美，好像又倒闭了又改成其他的。,"It's a pitfall completely.They are originally fradulent Longtou Decoration, now they become Damei Decoration.It seems that they can change again when they close down the store.","Swindle; they used to be the swindler company Longtou Renovation, then it’s changed to Damei, and now it seems they have closed down and changed into something else.",0.3726152126285683
所以大家别选择这样坑爹的装修公司。,So don't choose a decoration company like this.,So please don’t choose such a swindler company.,0.4097301217526274
以后大家在选择的时候多百度看看这些查一下这些咨询因为装修不是小钱。,"In the future, when you choose decoration company, you can search on Baidu frequently and counsult ofen because decoration is not cheap.","When you choose renovation companies in the future, please search them on Baidu because renovation cost is not a small amount.",0.0385810305120352

去之前看了店里的拍摄作品，更多的是户外婚纱，拍的很漂亮，涉及到的拍摄风格也很多。,"I had gone to the store and saw the works, pictures are mostly about outdoor wedding,which are very beautiful and involves many shooting styles.","I went to the store to see the photography works, and there were more beautiful outdoor wedding dress photos and a lot of different styles.",-0.7222746065311786
当天到了之后和小姐姐简单交流了自己的想法，非常耐心地帮我试了两套我纠结的风格衣服，最终敲定开始化妆造型~摄影师拍摄之前会摆一些道具，会指导动作，对各个细节也比较精益求精。,"I briefly exchanged my ideas with a girl after arriving there, she was patient to help me to try two set of clothes that I was uncertain,and finnaly I made the decision and started to makeup. Before shooting, the photographer put some props, guided the movements, and refined on many details.","After I arrived that day, I communicated my own ideas with the young lady and she patiently helped me try on two outfits I was having trouble deciding and I made the final decision before starting styling and makeup~ the photographer would place some props and guide me to pose before the shoot, and was very attentive to the details.",0.0200235759500056
但是可能因为没和我交流具体的拍摄想法，所以拍出来的不是我想要的风格，但是应该是好看的🙊🙊,"However, because I didn't communicate with him about the specific shooting ideas, the shooting style was not what I wanted, but it should be beautiful.🙊🙊","However, the photos taken were not in the style I wanted, perhaps it was because they didn’t communicate with me about the specific shooting ideas, but the photos should look nice🙊🙊",0.5953046673729235
拍好之后摄影师会帮忙挑选照片，交流后期风格，感觉挺细心的叭。,"After shooting, the photographer will help to select photos and communicate the post-production style. I feel quite careful.","After the shoot, the photographer would help pick the photos, communicate about post-editing style, and I think it was very thoughtful.",-0.3325680607285569

最后选择了一件黑色的纱裙，体验下不同的风格。,"Finally, I chose a black gauze dress to experience different styles.","Eventually, I chose a black veil skirt so as to experience a different style.",0.5953046673729235
整个拍摄过程要2个小时左右，化妆+拍摄，负责拍摄的摄影师是95后的弟弟呢，感觉稍微还是有点青涩，希望在顾客拍摄动作指导方面以后能给更多的建议呀～挺健谈的，拍摄过程比较愉快。,"The whole shooting process takes about 2 hours,makeup and shooting included.  the photographer responsible for shooting is the younger brother of the post-95s generation.I feel he is still a green hand. I hope he can give more suggestions on customer shooting action guidance in the future.He is quite talkative and the shooting process is relatively pleasant.","The entire photoshoot took about 2 hours including the makeup and shoot; the photographer was a young guy born after 1995, who seemed to be a little shy; I hope he could give more advice to clients in terms of poses~ he was talkative and the shoot was pleasant.",-1.5202451526984515

到店先填了姓名电话然后选服装，婚纱都可以选，换了三四套服装还蛮耐心的，选好后化妆化了很久，服务态度也好，后面拍摄会教你怎么摆造型，就是拍出来的感觉脸好大，精修说是要半个月，三四天就发来了，感觉好像跟原片没啥差别,"When you come to the store,  you fill in your name and phone number first, and then choose your wedding dress. Shop assistants are quite patient to accompany you to change three or four sets of clothes. After choosing the wedding dress, I started to make up and it took much time,and their attitude is good.

足浴盆泡脚发麻是漏电了吗？,Is the foot washing a leak of electricity?,Does it mean there is leakage of electricity if my feet feel numb in the feet bath basin?,0.4097301217526274
选择合适的的足浴盆可以起到很好的足疗保健作用，今天国美小编将针对这个问题做出解答，希望对朋友们有所帮助。,"Choosing the right foot bath can play a good role in foot care, and today's National American Review will answer this question, hoping to help friends.","Choosing the right feet bath basin can provide good pedicure and healthcare, and today Gome will answer this question; hopefully it will be helpful to you.",-0.3325680607285569
随着人们保健意识的增强，足浴盆越来越受到消费者的喜爱，在市场上也涌现出一大批档次不同的产品，从一百多元到上千元的足浴盆琳琅满目，给了消费者很大的选择空间。,"With the improvement of people's health awareness, foot baths are increasingly loved by consumers, and a large number of different products have emerged in the market, ranging from more than one hundred to thousands of yuan, giving consumers a great choice of space.","As people care more about healthcare, feet bath basin has become more popular among the customers, and a large batch of products of different levels have emerged on the market, from a little more than 100 yuan up to a thousand yuan, giving the customers a lot of options.",0.5953046673729235
在相关的数据表面，与传统家电相比，足浴盆等保健类家电销售火爆，但足浴盆并没有专门行业标准，因此存在一定的安全隐患。,"In the related data surface, compared with traditional household appliances, foot baths and other healthcare household appliances are sold, but foot baths do not have special industry standards, so there are certain safety hazards.","According to related statistics, compared with traditional home appliances, the sales of healthcare products such as feet bath basin was hot, but there is no specialized industry standard for feet bath basin and so there is potential safety risk.",0.5953046673729235

李先生告诉记者，近日，他买了一个足浴盆送给父亲做生日礼物，可是父亲泡脚时却感觉脚底发麻。,"Mr. Lee told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath for his father's birthday gift, but when his father washed his feet, he felt the bottom of his feet.","Mr. Li told reporter that he recently bought a feet bath basin for his father as a birthday present, but his father felt that the bottom of his feet were numb when using it.",-0.3325680607285569
李先生一开始以为是足浴盆的振动功能引起的，没想到关了振动功能，父亲还是感觉到脚底麻麻的。,"Mr. Li initially thought it was the vibration function of the foot bath basin caused, did not think of shutting off the vibration function, the father still felt the foothills of the foot.","Mr. Li first thought it was caused by the vibration function of the feet bath basin, and it was unexpected that his father still felt his feet were numb after turning off the vibration function.",-2.188313516931517
李先生用电笔一试，电笔居然亮了，李先生惊讶地发现足浴盆的水里居然带电。,"Mr. Lee tried with an electric pen, and the pen was actually lit, and Mr. Lee was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was actually powered.",Mr. Li used a tester and the light on it was on; it was to Mr. Li’s surprise that the water in the feet bath basin was electrified.,-0.3325680607285569
后来他联络了商家，商家的态度还不错，尽管退掉了足浴盆，李先生依然感到不快。,"Later he contacted the businessman, the businessman's attitude was good, and despite the withdrawal of the foot bath, Mr. Lee still felt uncomfortable.","Then he contacted the seller, whose attitude was nice, but Mr. Li still felt upset although he had returned it.",0.5953046673729235
因为他发现这个已经流行已久的足浴盆如今在最高温度的设定、适用于何种人群、何种材料保证无害等方面都没有一个明确详细的行业规定。,"Because he found that this has been popular for a long time, there is no clear detailed industry regulation in the setting of the highest temperature, which population is suitable for, which materials guarantee harmlessness.","Because he found that feet bath basin, which has been popular for a long time, still has no explicit and detailed industry regulations on the setting of the maximum temperature, suitable crowd, what materials are safe to use, etc.",0.4097301217526274
但是一般情况下足浴盆是不会有带电问题的，但也不排除少数产品在出厂时没有严格把关。,"But in general, foot baths will not have electricity problems, but it does not rule out that a few products do not have strict shutdowns when they are out of the factory.","But normally feet bath basin shouldn’t be electrified, however we can’t rule out the fact that a few products might not have been strictly checked before leaving the factory.",-0.3325680607285569
因此在在购买的时候选择分体式的足浴盆。,"Therefore, choose a split-shaped foot bathtub when buying.","Therefore, choose split type feet bath basin.",0.5953046673729235

我是第一次到店只是给他们看了我的户型图，他们并没有去实地量过房子，他们居然就能给我报价说我的135的房子7万是可以搞定的，大概的给我看了一下他们的材料也并不知道他们是什么品牌的材料。,"I was the first time to the store just to show them my house model map, they did not go to the field to measure the house, they could offer me to say my 135 house 70,000 can be done, probably showed me a look at their materials and did not know what brand of materials they were.","When I first came to the store, I showed them my floor plan; although they didn’t really go to my apartment to take the measurement, they said they could do it within 70,000 for my 135 square meters apartment, and they showed me their materials whose brand was unclear.",-3.301760790653294
他们的第二套骗术就是你只要到店就会拖着你把定金交了（而这个钱一旦交了你是永远退不出来，除非你有足够的经历和他们打理论战）。,"Their second set of tricks is that you’ll drag your cash back as soon as you go to the store (and that money you’ll never get back once you’ve paid it, unless you have enough experience with them).","The second scam was forcing you to pay the deposit, which cannot be refunded once paid, unless you have enough experience to reason with them.",-1.4460153344503333
我在犹豫要不要交定金的时候，他们就会邀请他们所谓的经理来告诉你，你今天只要把定金交了我们就能给你多少的优惠。,"When I was hesitant about whether to make a deposit, they would invite their so-called managers to tell you how much you can give you today if you give the deposit.","As I hesitated about whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me that once I paid the deposit on that day, they could give me certain discount.",-0.3325680607285569
这个就是一个大坑，我就是活生生被骗的例子，在头脑冲动的时候，交了一万多的定金。,"This is a big pit, I am a living example of being cheated, when the mind impulses, pay more than ten thousand deposits.","This is a big swindle, and I was a victim who paid a deposit of more than 10,000 when I didn’t really think it through.",-1.4645727890123628
他给我的报价有很多问题7万不包括水电改造，不包括任何门和橱柜 浴室，而这三个就是基装的费用大头。,"He offered me a lot of questions about 70,000 not including hydraulic transformation, not including any doors and cabinets in the bathroom, and these three are the main cost of the base.","Their quoted price had a lot of problems; for instance, the 70,000 didn’t include water and electricity renovation, doors, cabinets or bathrooms, and these three take up a large proportion of the cost of basic installation.",-3.116186245032998
除去这些他们的服务点费收的也比其他家公司的高。,"In addition to these, their service fees are also higher than those of other companies.","Apart from these, their service point fee is also higher than that of other companies.",0.5953046673729235
我对这个公司失去了信任，一开始什么都没有讲清楚就让我签合同。,"I lost my confidence in the company, and without saying anything clear at first, I signed the contract.","I’ve lost trust in this company, because they asked me to sign the contract when they didn’t explain anything clearly.",-0.3325680607285569
当我去找他们退钱的时候他们表现出很有经验的样子，有专门的小团队来对付你。,"When I went to get them back, they looked experienced and had a dedicated small team to deal with you.","When I went to ask for a refund, they acted rather experienced and sent a small team to deal with me.",-1.260440788830037
无论如何都会一口咬死是客户的问题他们全然无责。,"Anyway, a bite to death is the problem of the customer they are not at all responsible.","Anyway, they just said it was the client’s problem and they had absolutely no responsibility for it.",-0.3325680607285569
各种推卸责任，还有很多细节，不想一一说了都是泪，总之不要选择他们，因为我朋友找他们装修的房子也是质量不好，后期给你算各种费用。,"Various deployment responsibilities, and a lot of details, do not want to say one by one are tears, in any case do not choose them, because my friend to find them renovated the house is also poor quality, you will be charged with various costs.","They just shrunk their responsibility in any way possible, and there were a lot more details that I don’t want to mention now; all in all, do not choose them because my friend had them renovate her apartment, and the quality was poor and they would charge you all kinds of other costs in the later stage.",-2.2439858806176063
坑爹，他们就是原来骗人的龙头装饰，现在改成大美，好像又倒闭了又改成其他的。,"They were the former liars, and now they are transformed into great beauty, as if they were shut down again and changed to others.","Swindle; they used to be the swindler company Longtou Renovation, then it’s changed to Damei, and now it seems they have closed down and changed into something else.",-4.044058973134479
所以大家别选择这样坑爹的装修公司。,So don’t choose such a foolish repair company.,So please don’t choose such a swindler company.,-1.260440788830037
以后大家在选择的时候多百度看看这些查一下这些咨询因为装修不是小钱。,"After all, when choosing more than a hundred times check out these advice because the renovation is not a small money.","When you choose renovation companies in the future, please search them on Baidu because renovation cost is not a small amount.",-1.4460153344503333

当天到了之后和小姐姐简单交流了自己的想法，非常耐心地帮我试了两套我纠结的风格衣服，最终敲定开始化妆造型~摄影师拍摄之前会摆一些道具，会指导动作，对各个细节也比较精益求精。,"After the day came and the sister simply exchanged their ideas, very patiently helped me to try two sets of style clothes I curved, and finally decided to start makeup shapes - the photographer will put some items before shooting, will guide the action, and improve the details.","After I arrived that day, I communicated my own ideas with the young lady and she patiently helped me try on two outfits I was having trouble deciding and I made the final decision before starting styling and makeup~ the photographer would place some props and guide me to pose before the shoot, and was very attentive to the details.",-5.918361883899469
但是可能因为没和我交流具体的拍摄想法，所以拍出来的不是我想要的风格，但是应该是好看的🙊🙊,"But maybe because I didn't communicate concrete shooting ideas with me, so it wasn't the style I wanted, but it should be nice.","However, the photos taken were not in the style I wanted, perhaps it was because they didn’t communicate with me about the specific shooting ideas, but the photos should look nice🙊🙊",-0.5181426063488529
拍好之后摄影师会帮忙挑选照片，交流后期风格，感觉挺细心的叭。,"After taking a good photo, the photographer will help select photos, exchange later styles, feel very careful.","After the shoot, the photographer would help pick the photos, communicate about post-editing style, and I think it was very thoughtful.",-2.188313516931517

最后选择了一件黑色的纱裙，体验下不同的风格。,"Finally, a black dress was chosen to experience different styles.","Eventually, I chose a black veil skirt so as to experience a different style.",-1.260440788830037
整个拍摄过程要2个小时左右，化妆+拍摄，负责拍摄的摄影师是95后的弟弟呢，感觉稍微还是有点青涩，希望在顾客拍摄动作指导方面以后能给更多的建议呀～挺健谈的，拍摄过程比较愉快。,"The entire shooting process takes about 2 hours, makeup + shooting, the photographer responsible for shooting is the 95-year-old brother, it feels a little bit dull, hopefully in the customer's shooting action guidance after can give more advice - very good talk, the shooting process is more enjoyable.","The entire photoshoot took about 2 hours including the makeup and shoot; the photographer was a young guy born after 1995, who seemed to be a little shy; I hope he could give more advice to clients in terms of poses~ he was talkative and the shoot was pleasant.",-5.027604064922048
